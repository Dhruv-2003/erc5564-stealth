# erc5564-stealth-lib

[Library](https://github.com/Dhruv-2003/erc5564-stealth/tree/main/stealth-lib) exposes the functions from the Rust-based `eth-stealth-addresses` library as a **WASM-compatible module**. It allows seamless usage of stealth address functionality in JavaScript/TypeScript environments.

### Modifications
